# Pixelwise - Intelligent Photo Gallery

A React-based adaptive photo gallery that intelligently optimizes user experience based on network conditions, device capabilities, and viewing behavior. Pixelwise automatically adjusts image quality, loading strategies, and performance metrics to deliver the best possible experience across all devices and connection speeds.

## 🎯 What Makes Pixelwise Smart

- **Network-Aware Loading**: Automatically detects 2G, 3G, 4G, and WiFi connections to optimize image quality
- **Adaptive Performance**: Real-time monitoring and adjustment based on device capabilities
- **Intelligent Lazy Loading**: Uses Intersection Observer API for efficient viewport-based loading
- **Background Processing**: Leverages idle time for image optimization and preloading
- **Canvas-Powered Editing**: Real-time image filters and effects without external dependencies

## 🚀 Key Features

### Performance Intelligence
- **Real-time Metrics Dashboard**: Monitor loading times, data usage, and efficiency
- **Network Simulation**: Test different connection scenarios for development
- **Before/After Comparisons**: Visualize optimization benefits
- **Memory Management**: Efficient loading and unloading of off-screen images

### Adaptive User Experience
- **Smart Quality Selection**: Automatically chooses optimal image quality based on network
- **Progressive Loading**: LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders) → Full resolution
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts from single-column mobile to multi-column desktop
- **Touch-Optimized**: Mobile-first design with proper touch targets

### Developer Features
- **Network Condition Testing**: Simulate various connection speeds
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive analytics and metrics
- **API Usage Indicators**: Track which Web APIs are actively being used
- **Geolocation Integration**: Location-based image suggestions and organization

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with modern hooks and component architecture
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables
- **Web APIs Integration**:
  - Intersection Observer API (lazy loading and viewport detection)
  - Network Information API (connection quality monitoring)
  - Canvas API (image processing and filter effects)
  - Background Tasks API (idle-time optimization)
  - Geolocation API (location-based features)
